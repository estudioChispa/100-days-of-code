## Log

### R2D16 - March 29, 208
Maybe a collectionView instead of a tableView?  #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D15 - March 28, 2018
Pulling my hair out over auto layout constraints. Just when I think I'm getting it, it all falls apart. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D14 - March 27, 2018
Tried the Master-Detail template. Spent more time removing and undoing the parts I didn't need than if I had just started from scratch. Lesson learned. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D13 - March 26, 2018
Custom cell layouts. Too many options. I just need to stop changing my mind, and move forward. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D12 - March 25, 2018
Tired today, not super productive but did spend some time coding. Little by little. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D11 - March 24, 2018
Segues, segues, segues. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D10 - March 23, 2018
So excited about getting a #WWDC ticket it's been hard to concentrate on my actual coding. Focus! :-) #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D9 - March 22, 2018
Playing around with different segues. Hadn't thought about using a splitViewController, but I think it's exactly what I need. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D8 - March 21, 2018
Spent some time with WWDC videos today. My brain is full. üß† #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D7 - March 20, 2018
Got distracted by an idea for iMessage Sticker Pack. On the one hand, I learned all about making a sticker set. On the other hand, I didn't get anything done on my app. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D6 - March 19, 2018
Feeling a little under the weather today, but worked on the mapView of my app for a bit. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D5 - March 18, 2018
Started basic layout of my app in Xcode. So far, so good. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D4 - March 17, 2018
Finalized (I hope) the data structure for my app. I was over thinking it and finally just went with a much simpler solution. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D3 - March 16, 2018
More Adaptive Layout. ‚ù§Ô∏è WWDC videos! #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D2 - March 15, 2018
Focusing on Adaptive Layout today. Yesterday's work on localization went well. And, of course, today is dedicated to R2D2. :-) #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D1 - March 14, 2018
Starting on round 2! More of a plan than I had last round. Learned a lot last time, but hope to have more to show for it this time. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS
