The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [March 14, Wednesday, 2018].

## Log

### R2D7 - March 20, 2018
Got distracted by an idea for iMessage Sticker Pack. On the one hand, I learned all about making a sticker set. On the other hand, I didn't get anything done on my app. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D6 - March 19, 2018
Feeling a little under the weather today, but worked on the mapView of my app for a bit. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D5 - March 18, 2018
Started basic layout of my app in Xcode. So far, so good. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D4 - March 17, 2018
Finalized (I hope) the data structure for my app. I was over thinking it and finally just went with a much simpler solution. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D3 - March 16, 2018
More Adaptive Layout. ❤️ WWDC videos! #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D2 - March 15, 2018
Focusing on Adaptive Layout today. Yesterday's work on localization went well. And, of course, today is dedicated to R2D2. :-) #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D1 - March 14, 2018
Starting on round 2! More of a plan than I had last round. Learned a lot last time, but hope to have more to show for it this time. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS
