The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [March 14, Wednesday, 2018].

## Log

### R2D37 - April 19, 2018
Time well spent on tutorials yesterday. At least one "nice to have" feature I was thinking of would be super simple to add, but now that I've thought it through it doesn't add any real functionality and would seem like a dumb add-on.  #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D36 - April 18, 2018
Took a little break from working on the app and went through a couple of tutorials for some "nice to have" features I've been thinking about.  #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D35 - April 17, 2018
Updated the table view so that the cells look like cards. Added the map view back to the app. Decided to add another element to the scrollView and didn't break it this time. Yay! #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D34 - April 16, 2018
Made really good progress following yesterday's "Eureka!" moment. Right up until the time I broke the scrollView. Again. I'm still going to count this as 10 steps forward, only 1 step back. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS 

### R2D33 - April 15, 2018
Just when I was about to give up, I finally understood what the Apple Documentation had been trying to tell me all along about UITabBarController. Yay! Ending this coding session on a high note. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS 

### R2D32 - April 14, 2018
Back to the splitViewController. Most of it's working. :-) #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS 

### R2D31 - April 13, 2018
Nothing spectacular today, just doing some cleanup. Spent some time mapping out the steps needed to finish up this app. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS 

### R2D30 - April 12, 2018
Frustrating day. Not a lot of time to code, and spent most of it struggling to do something that turned out to be so simple. At least it's working now. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS 

### R2D29 - April 11, 2018
Need to revisit some tutorials on view controller transitions and animations now that I'm at the point where I'm ready to implement. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D28 - April 10, 2018
Really productive day. Fun to see my app taking shape! #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D27 - April 9, 2018
A little more work on the mapView. Connecting all the parts of the app. Think it's finally coming together. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D26 - April 8, 2018
Probably because I've struggled with autolayout so much lately, I think I'm finally getting it. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D25 - April 7, 2018
Working on a few autolayout issues, focusing on adaptive layout for the various size classes / traits. It feels like one step forward and two steps back, but it's slowly coming together.  #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D24 - April 6, 2018
Not a lot of time to code today, but managed to clean up a few things. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D23 - April 5, 2018
I have conquered the scrollView with dynamic height problem! Now to have some fun making the app icon. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D22 - April 4, 2018
Broke the scrollview I worked on yesterday. :-( #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D21 - April 3, 2018
Working on a scrollview with dynamic height. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D20 - April 2, 2018
Cleaned up some code. Made cute little icons for a tab view controller. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D19 - April 1, 2018
Some days the simple stuff ends up taking forever. Sigh. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D18 - March 31, 2018
Rounded corners and shadows don't like to play nice together. Thank you Stack Overflow for helping me understand why. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D17 - March 30, 2018
Learned how to change the width of the master view in a splitView Controller. Thanks to @kharrison (useyourloaf.com)! #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D16 - March 29, 2018
Maybe a collectionView instead of a tableView?  #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D15 - March 28, 2018
Pulling my hair out over auto layout constraints. Just when I think I'm getting it, it all falls apart. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D14 - March 27, 2018
Tried the Master-Detail template. Spent more time removing and undoing the parts I didn't need than if I had just started from scratch. Lesson learned. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D13 - March 26, 2018
Custom cell layouts. Too many options. I just need to stop changing my mind, and move forward. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D12 - March 25, 2018
Tired today, not super productive but did spend some time coding. Little by little. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D11 - March 24, 2018
Segues, segues, segues. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D10 - March 23, 2018
So excited about getting a #WWDC ticket it's been hard to concentrate on my actual coding. Focus! :-) #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D9 - March 22, 2018
Playing around with different segues. Hadn't thought about using a splitViewController, but I think it's exactly what I need. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D8 - March 21, 2018
Spent some time with WWDC videos today. My brain is full. 🧠 #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D7 - March 20, 2018
Got distracted by an idea for iMessage Sticker Pack. On the one hand, I learned all about making a sticker set. On the other hand, I didn't get anything done on my app. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D6 - March 19, 2018
Feeling a little under the weather today, but worked on the mapView of my app for a bit. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D5 - March 18, 2018
Started basic layout of my app in Xcode. So far, so good. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D4 - March 17, 2018
Finalized (I hope) the data structure for my app. I was over thinking it and finally just went with a much simpler solution. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D3 - March 16, 2018
More Adaptive Layout. ❤️ WWDC videos! #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D2 - March 15, 2018
Focusing on Adaptive Layout today. Yesterday's work on localization went well. And, of course, today is dedicated to R2D2. :-) #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS

### R2D1 - March 14, 2018
Starting on round 2! More of a plan than I had last round. Learned a lot last time, but hope to have more to show for it this time. #100DaysOfCode #Swift #iOS
