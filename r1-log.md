## Log

### R1D1 
Running throught the MapKit tutorial on RayWenderlich.com to get back in the swing of things with my Statues app. <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/160517/mapkit-tutorial-getting-started">Mapkit Tutorial</a>

### R1D2
Finishing up MapKit tutorial. Focusing on adding annotations and json.

### R1D3
More iOS stuff. User Location Authorization. Review of some syntax I had forgotten. Brain is full.

### R1D4
Closures, closures, closures. Why does this syntax cause me so much confusion? Working through it.

### R1D5
Basic layout of my iOS app. It includes a map which is why I spent time with the MapKit tutorial. Super helpful.

### R1D6
iOS and Swift. Today’s topic: Auto Layout. Trouble with a scroll view not working as expected led to a tutorial or two.

### R1D7
iOS and Swift. Working on adding search to my app and rethinking data structure.

### R1D8
iOS and Swift. Tweaking layout of table cells. Spent some time learning more about Git.

### R1D9
iOS and Swift. Setting up calls to the data source and figuring out how to handle the JSON data that’s returned.

### R1D10
iOS and Swift. More fun with JSON today.

### R1D11
Got distracted with some HTML stuff and Stack Overflow today. Did learn some Swift stuff from a question on SO, though.
