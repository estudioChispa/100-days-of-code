The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [December 1, Friday, 2017].

## Log

### R1D21 
iOS and Swift. Note to self: Sometimes you just have to restart Xcode, rather than continuing to try and find the problem that you’re pretty sure you’ve already fixed.

### R1D20 
iOS and Swift. Don’t feel like I made much progress today. I guess some days are just harder than others.

### R1D19
iOS and Swift. Added a segmented control and code to limit the search to specific categories.

### R1D18
Hard to find time to code today. Cleaned up a  few things from yesterday. Nothing really new to report today.

### R1D17
More error handling. And tracking down a bug. Sigh.

### R1D16
iOS and Swift. Today’s topic: URL Session and error handling. Hope to have more time to code tomorrow. Today was a short day, but at least I got a little bit of coding in.

### R1D15
iOS and Swift. Learning more about asynchronous queues and GCD. Going slower than I had hoped, but learning a lot.

### R1D14
iOS and Swift. More asynchronous stuff. Spent a little time on some accessibility elements, too.

### R1D13
iOS and Swift. Asynchronous network requests. Just learned about the Network Link Conditioner to simulate a really slow connection. Cool!

### R1D12
iOS and Swift. Trying to get my head around the difference between casting “as! String”, “as! String?”, and “as? String”.

### R1D11
Got distracted with some HTML stuff and Stack Overflow today. Did learn some Swift stuff from a question on SO, though.

### R1D10
iOS and Swift. More fun with JSON today.

### R1D9
iOS and Swift. Setting up calls to the data source and figuring out how to handle the JSON data that’s returned.

### R1D8
iOS and Swift. Tweaking layout of table cells. Spent some time learning more about Git.

### R1D7
iOS and Swift. Working on adding search to my app and rethinking data structure.

### R1D6
iOS and Swift. Today’s topic: Auto Layout. Trouble with a scroll view not working as expected led to a tutorial or two.

### R1D5
Basic layout of my iOS app. It includes a map which is why I spent time with the MapKit tutorial. Super helpful.

### R1D4
Closures, closures, closures. Why does this syntax cause me so much confusion? Working through it.

### R1D3
More iOS stuff. User Location Authorization. Review of some syntax I had forgotten. Brain is full.

### R1D2
Finishing up MapKit tutorial. Focusing on adding annotations and json.

### R1D1 
Running throught the MapKit tutorial on RayWenderlich.com to get back in the swing of things with my Statues app. <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/160517/mapkit-tutorial-getting-started">Mapkit Tutorial</a>
