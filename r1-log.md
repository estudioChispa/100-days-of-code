## Log

### R1D89
iOS and Swift. Spent some time with dictionaries. Can't believe how close I'm getting to day 100!

### R1D88
iOS and Swift. Seems weird that I've never used an @IBOutlet Collection before. But now I have. 

### R1D87
iOS and Swift. I am totally addicted to the Stanford iTunesU course, "Developing iOS 11 Apps with Swift." Currently binge watching.

### R1D86
iOS and Swift. Spent some time with the Stanford iTunesU course, CS193P "Developing iOS 11 Apps with Swift", with Paul Hegarty. Really great. 

### R1D85
iOS and Swift. Ugh, I'm beginning to think that having a scrolling text view inside a collection view cell is more trouble than it is worth.

### R1D84
iOS and Swift. Not feeling all that great today, but managed to get in some coding time.

### R1D83
iOS and Swift. Not a very productive day. Trying to make sure I understand CollectionViews.

### R1D82
iOS and Swift. Investigating Hero transitions library. Fun stuff!

### R1D81 
iOS and Swift. Finally know how I want the views in my app to segue to / from one another. Now, to make what I see in my mind a reality.

### R1D80
Wow, I’ve made it to Day 80!

### R1D79
iOS and Swift. Working on animating transitions. Fun stuff.

### R1D78
iOS and Swift. Found a couple of really good tutorials on CocoaPods and Carthage. Will definitely implement in my current project for HTTP networking and animation.

### R1D77
iOS and Swift. More on CocoaPods and Carthage. And some time spent on StackOverflow.

### R1D76
iOS and Swift. Learning about CocoaPods and Carthage today.

### R1D75
iOS and Swift. Thought I was going to have so much time to spend coding today. Oh, well. At least I can spend the next hour on it.

### R1D74
iOS and Swift. Doing a quick review of some recent work.

### R1D73
iOS and Swift. A little follow up on my macOS menu bar app. Learned about macOS global event monitor today.

### R1D72
iOS and Swift. Slow and steady. Okay, sometimes not so steady. Can't believe it's day 72!

### R1D71
iOS and Swift. Struggling with typos. Probably should've done my coding earlier in the day. Also learning about Singletons.

### R1D70
iOS and Swift. Working with Date and time formatting. Nothing too exciting.

### R1D69
iOS and Swift. Finishing up the menu bar app. And realizing that I passed the 2/3 mark a couple of days ago -- 100 days is not far off now!

### R1D68
iOS and Swift. Forgot to post this yesterday. More on the menu bar app. 

### R1D67
iOS and Swift. Got distracted with an idea for a Mac OS menu bar app. No work on my iOS app today, but learned a lot!

### R1D66
iOS and Swift. Lots of mistakes today. Felt like one step forward and 3 steps back. Hope I've got things back on track. 

### R1D65
iOS and Swift. Not a lot of actual coding today, but spent some time on Stack Overflow finding answers.

### R1D64
iOS and Swift. Struggling with one problem for way too long. Sigh. I think I need to take a walk and come back to it with a clear mind.

### R1D63
iOS and Swift. Slowly making progress. Feel like I don't have to look every little thing up.

### R1D62
iOS and Swift. Not a lot of time today, but did work on how I want to handle the data in my current app. 

### R1D61
iOS and Swift. Reviewing the code I've been working on for the last few days. 

### R1D60
iOS and Swift. More time with expandable table view cells and trying to get the cell layout the way I want.

### R1D59
iOS and Swift. Not much progress, but still coding every day which is my main goal.

### R1D58
iOS and Swift. Slow progress, but I at least feel like I'm moving forward.

### R1D57
iOS and Swift. Exploring expandable table view cells. This may be the direction I go for the detail views.

### R1D56
iOS and Swift. Back on the map part of my project. The map itself is mostly done, just rethinking the layout of the detail views.

### R1D55
iOS and Swift. Tried a cool animation tutorial but the code was so beyond my current capabilities that I stopped halfway through. But, I did learn how to set constraints programmatically, so there's that.

### R1D54
iOS and Swift. Researching tvOS. One little question led to more and more questions. Of course, now I want to make an app for Apple TV.

### R1D53
Looks like I numbered yesterday’s entry incorrectly. Should’ve been R1D52. So today is R1D53
iOS and Swift. Taking a break from working on my project to run through a tutorial (or two).

### R1D51
iOS and Swift. Changing up the data structure a bit. 

### R1D51
iOS and Swift. Smooth sailing today. Prettying up a table.

### R1D50
iOS and Swift. Day 50! Spent time reviewing some code that I've written so far.

### R1D49
iOS and Swift. Can't believe that tomorrow will be the halfway point!

### R1D48
iOS and Swift. Lots of interruptions today. Feeling like I didn't make any progress on my project. 

### R1D47
iOS and Swift. Tutorials and some time spent with Stack Overflow.

### R1D46
iOS and Swift. A slow day. Some things worked, some things didn't. Hope to have more time to code tomorrow.

### R1D45
iOS and Swift. Reviewing some Core Data stuff.

### R1D44
iOS and Swift. Finally got the date that the "to do list" item was added to show up as the section header. Don't know why I struggled so much getting the Date formatted as text. The final bit of code is so simple. 

### R1D43
iOS and Swift. Success today with my table layout. So far, so good!

### R1D42 
iOS and Swift. Trying to figure out the best way to lay out the table view cells for this app. We’ll see how this turns out.

### R1D41 
Oops… this should’ve been combined with D40. New project. Design stuff. Basic layout in code. Blah blah blah.

### R1D40 
iOS and Swift. Started a new project. A little bit of code and some time spent on the design. (forgot to tweet this yesterday)

### R1D39 
iOS and Swift. Today was a struggle. Nothing seemed to be working. Deep breath and try again.

### R1D38 
iOS and Swift. Today’s reminder: The order in which you do things matters. Sigh.

### R1D37 
iOS and Swift. Got totally sidetracked learning about crash logs. My app isn’t crashing (yet), but I came across the term symbolification and had to learn more.

### R1D36 
iOS and Swift. Working with ScrollViews and fixing some AutoLayout issues.

### R1D35 
iOS and Swift A little more review. It’s been a busy week, but feels good to have time set aside for code.

### R1D34 
iOS and Swift. Reviewing a few concepts that I obviously did not completely understand. 

### R1D33 
iOS and Swift. Feel like I’m just stumbling about in Xcode today. I think tomorrow I’ll set aside some time to review what I’ve been learning lately and see if that helps.

### R1D32 
iOS and Swift. Thinking about a view controller being a part of another view controller. And more animations, of course.

### R1D31 
iOS and Swift. Had so much fun with the animations yesterday that I did some more today. 

### R1D30
iOS and Swift. Made it through the AutoLayout swamp. Playing with some animation stuff today.

### R1D29 
iOS and Swift. Struggling a little with AutoLayout. Probably just need a cuppa tea.

### R1D28 
iOS and Swift. Changing the layout up a little bit — a pop up in place of the standard detail view.

### R1D27 
iOS and Swift. Learning about Presentation Controllers and Animation Controllers.

### R1D26 
iOS and Swift. Researched a couple of third-party networking libraries. Started on the detail view layout for my app. 

### R1D25 
iOS and Swift. More MapKit and some JSON stuff. Busy day. Just glad I made some time to code today.

### R1D24 
iOS and Swift. More MapKit fun and games. I don’t why I’m having so much trouble with MKMapSnapshotter.

### R1D23 
iOS and Swift. Took a break from Core Data to go back to a question I had regarding MapKit. Things are going much smoother this time. Maybe some of this is starting to sink in.

### R1D22 
iOS and Swift. Spent some more time learning about Core Data.

### R1D21 
iOS and Swift. Note to self: Sometimes you just have to restart Xcode, rather than continuing to try and find the problem that you’re pretty sure you’ve already fixed.

### R1D20 
iOS and Swift. Don’t feel like I made much progress today. I guess some days are just harder than others.

### R1D19
iOS and Swift. Added a segmented control and code to limit the search to specific categories.

### R1D18
Hard to find time to code today. Cleaned up a  few things from yesterday. Nothing really new to report today.

### R1D17
More error handling. And tracking down a bug. Sigh.

### R1D16
iOS and Swift. Today’s topic: URL Session and error handling. Hope to have more time to code tomorrow. Today was a short day, but at least I got a little bit of coding in.

### R1D15
iOS and Swift. Learning more about asynchronous queues and GCD. Going slower than I had hoped, but learning a lot.

### R1D14
iOS and Swift. More asynchronous stuff. Spent a little time on some accessibility elements, too.

### R1D13
iOS and Swift. Asynchronous network requests. Just learned about the Network Link Conditioner to simulate a really slow connection. Cool!

### R1D12
iOS and Swift. Trying to get my head around the difference between casting “as! String”, “as! String?”, and “as? String”.

### R1D11
Got distracted with some HTML stuff and Stack Overflow today. Did learn some Swift stuff from a question on SO, though.

### R1D10
iOS and Swift. More fun with JSON today.

### R1D9
iOS and Swift. Setting up calls to the data source and figuring out how to handle the JSON data that’s returned.

### R1D8
iOS and Swift. Tweaking layout of table cells. Spent some time learning more about Git.

### R1D7
iOS and Swift. Working on adding search to my app and rethinking data structure.

### R1D6
iOS and Swift. Today’s topic: Auto Layout. Trouble with a scroll view not working as expected led to a tutorial or two.

### R1D5
Basic layout of my iOS app. It includes a map which is why I spent time with the MapKit tutorial. Super helpful.

### R1D4
Closures, closures, closures. Why does this syntax cause me so much confusion? Working through it.

### R1D3
More iOS stuff. User Location Authorization. Review of some syntax I had forgotten. Brain is full.

### R1D2
Finishing up MapKit tutorial. Focusing on adding annotations and json.

### R1D1 
Running throught the MapKit tutorial on RayWenderlich.com to get back in the swing of things with my Statues app. <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/160517/mapkit-tutorial-getting-started">Mapkit Tutorial</a>
